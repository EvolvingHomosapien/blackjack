**About**:

JavaScript Data Types Quiz: This is a 10 question quiz game built to help developers learn and differentiate between the various eight data types in JavaScript. JavaScript was the first language that I learned in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp. I originally built this quiz to help myself learn the various eight datatypes in JavaScript, but I soon realized it could help others, too.

**Technologies Used** JavaScript, HTML, CSS. 

**Getting Started**: 

You can begin the JavaScript Data Types quiz by simply selecting your answer to the first question of the quiz. If you answer correctly, your answer will be highlighted in green. If it is an incorrect answer, your answer will be highlighted in red. Regardless of whether you select the correct answer, you will see the correct answer highlighted in green. After your answer has been selected, just press the "NEXT QUESTION" button to proceed to the next question. Your final score will appear out of 10 once you have completed the quiz. You can replay the quiz by pressing the "PLAY AGAIN?" button.

**Next Steps & Ice Box Features**:

I would like to implement more data type questions in the question base with a randomized function so players can answer a wider variety of questions while receiving a different order and type of questions each run through.

I would like to create a home page different than the trivia page.

On the home page, I would like to implement an all-time high scores board where users can see who scored the highest. I would give players an option to input their name along with their score at the end of each quiz attempt.
